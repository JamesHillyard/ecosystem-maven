# Contributing to Payara

As with many open source projects Payara is hosted on Github, allowing anyone to contribute code and help with its development. To make sure that development is coordinated and that changes are easily tracked, we have a series of steps that should be followed in order to get your code merged.

## Legal Bits
Payara is an open source project, with the code owned by Payara Foundation a United Kingdom based not for profit company limited by guarantee. As Payara Foundation are the custodians of the code, we have specific legal requirements concerning how we distribute code contributed to the project. Before any code contributed by our community is pulled into our repository we must have a signed Contributor License Agreement from any contributor. This can be downloaded from the main repository at [https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/PayaraCLA.pdf](https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/PayaraCLA.pdf) and should be signed, scanned, and forwarded to [cla@payara.org](mailto:cla@payara.org). As compensation for wading through the legalese, all contributors who send in a signed Contributor License Agreement receive a Payara goodie bag.

## Responses

We continually check the github posted issues for bugs, feature requests, and assorted issues. If you have posted an issue, chances are it has been read by a member of staff. Requests for further information and labels are often posted in order to make it easier for the dev team to see issues. However if your issue has not received a comment or label, don't take this as it having not been read or acted upon!

If you do post an issue and we request further information from you please respond quickly. We review all issues periodically and if an issue has been waiting for a response since last review we will add the "requestor unresponsive" label. If on the second periodic review there has still been no response to our request we will add a second "requestor unresponsive" label. Finally if on the third review there is still no response we will close the issue. This ensures our GitHub issues stay up to date and relevant and doesn't get full of old issues. If you still have the same problem you can still comment on the closed issue and we will still see it and if necessary reopen the issue to pick up where we left off.
